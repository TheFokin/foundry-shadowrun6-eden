# Edge & Dice Release
*We've got a new release chummers!*

With this release, I can feel like we got most "MVP" features for a decently automated Shadowrun BTL-dive ready with the vtt system. We now also got **Extended Tests**, **Edge Boosts** that you can apply to already-rolled-tests, and FoundryVTT **V13** support.

Aside from that, I have started a [Patreon blog](https://www.patreon.com/DeepResonanceWare) to keep in contact with you â€” the GM's and Players. When there's a new release, I'll create a news update there for the free-tier.  
Feel free to post feedback on there!

Ohyeah, and try out the Dice So Nice preset & theme! :)
